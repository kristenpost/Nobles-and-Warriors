# Nobles-and-Warriors
Game Simulator

Purpose of Code: To model a game of Warriors and Nobles by means of object orientated programming. A key focus is inheritance. There are two types of Nobles; Lord and PersonWithStrength. Instead of simply having Warriors, there will be a Protector class, from which classes Wizards and Warriors will be derived from. Furthermore, there will be two different types of Warriors; derived classes Archer and Swordsmen.
